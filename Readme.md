Create art with basic geometric shapes. [Try it here!](http://codebleeder.github.com/Froebel)

### Inspiration
I bought this beautiful book on architecture, when I visited the very famous [Guggenheim](https://www.guggenheim.org/) museum with my friends:

The museum (You should visit it if you are in NYC - Can't miss Picasso or Van Gogh... can you?):

The first exercise in the book was to cut out these shapes and create art out of them:

I thought: why not write a web app to do it?
